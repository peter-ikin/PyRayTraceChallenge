# PyRayTraceChallenge
Python implementation of the "[The Ray Tracer Challenge](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/)" book by Jamis Buck.

## About
This is my implementation of the ray tracer challenge book. The code is written in standard Python3 ( no math libraries etc. are used.)
The BDD tests as described in the book are implemented with [Behave](https://github.com/behave/behave)

## Building and running.

### BDD Tests
Running the tests requires executing the behave command from the cli i.e. 
```console
foo@bar:~$ behave
```
